## About me

Hi! I write games and I like it! I'm Alex and welcome to my Github! I'm Gamedev and Gamedesigner and I upload my projects to Github to share them and discuss how they are programmed, which you will find later in this archive.

The reason is that I like my public repositories to be educational first and foremost. In the README you will find hints on how to improve the code!

If you like what I do, please follow me on my social networks!

## About the project

This project is a 2D shooting gallery with ducklings. The objective of the project is to show new Unity programmers how to create a complete project from scratch.

## About the development and improvements

I have included an options menu with sound and video options. The animations have been created by code and using Unity's own Animator. 

But the question in this project is...
If the game is always creating ducks, shoots and shoots effects, and destroying and creating them.... couldn't something be done to improve performance?
